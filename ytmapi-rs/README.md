# About
Ytmapi-rs - an asynchronous API for youtube music - using Google's internal API, Tokio and Reqwest. Inspired by https://github.com/sigma67/ytmusicapi/.

This project is not supported or endorsed by Google.
# WARNING
This crate is currently unsupported and undocumented.
It has been published to allowing publishing of Youtui (parent crate) to Crates.io.
In future it is expected that this will become a stand-alone crate.
